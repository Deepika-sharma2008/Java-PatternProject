#  Java Pattern Printing Project

## Project Overview

This project was created as part of my **BCA 2nd Year (Semester 3)** coursework at **Dezyen Ecole College**. It is a collection of **Java-based pattern programs**, developed to generate different types of visual patterns using loops and conditions.

All input in this project is taken using **`JOptionPane`**, a part of Java's Swing library, which provides **graphical input dialogs** for a better user experience.


##  Key Concepts Demonstrated

- âœ… Nested Loops
- âœ… Conditional Operators (`if-else`, ternary)
- âœ… Graphical Input using `JOptionPane`
- âœ… Modular Code Structure
- âœ… Logic Building through Pattern Design

## Pattern Types Included

The project contains a variety of pattern types, such as:

- **Pyramid Patterns**
- **Number Patterns**
- **Alphabet Patterns**
- **Hollow Patterns**
- **Diamond Patterns**
- **Right/Left Aligned Triangles**
- **Fibonacci Patterns**
- **Pascal's Triangle**
- And many more...

Each pattern is implemented using a separate class or method for clarity and easy access.
